\chapter{Background and Context}
\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Campus Placement Process}
The campus placement process represents a structured recruitment mechanism where companies visit educational institutions to select students for employment opportunities. This process typically follows a well-defined lifecycle:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pre-placement Activities:} The placement office initiates relationships with potential recruiting companies, while students prepare their resumes and professional profiles.
    
    \item \textbf{Company Registration:} Interested companies register with the institution, providing details about their organization, job profiles, requirements, and compensation packages.
    
    \item \textbf{Job Announcement:} The placement office announces job opportunities to eligible students based on criteria such as academic performance, department, and specific company requirements.
    
    \item \textbf{Student Application:} Interested and eligible students submit their applications with resumes and other required documents.
    
    \item \textbf{Application Screening:} Companies review applications and select candidates for further assessment.
    
    \item \textbf{Assessment Process:} Selected candidates undergo various assessment rounds, which may include aptitude tests, technical interviews, HR interviews, and group discussions.
    
    \item \textbf{Job Offers:} Successful candidates receive job offers with details of compensation and terms of employment.
    
    \item \textbf{Acceptance/Rejection:} Students decide whether to accept or reject the offers.
    
    \item \textbf{Post-placement Activities:} The placement office compiles statistics, gathers feedback, and prepares reports.
\end{enumerate}

Traditionally, this process has been managed through a combination of physical notice boards, email communications, spreadsheets, and paper documents. This manual approach often leads to challenges such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inefficient information dissemination
    \item Difficulties in tracking application status
    \item Challenges in matching student eligibility with job requirements
    \item Limited transparency in the selection process
    \item Cumbersome reporting and analysis
    \item Inconsistent communication between stakeholders
\end{itemize}

The Campus Placement Management System addresses these challenges by digitizing and automating the entire process, providing a centralized platform for all stakeholders.

\subsection{Role-Based Access Control}
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm that restricts system access based on users' roles within an organization. In the context of the Campus Placement Management System, RBAC is crucial for ensuring that users can only access information and perform actions appropriate to their role.

The system implements RBAC through the following key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Role Definition:} Distinct roles (student, admin) with clear responsibilities
    \item \textbf{Permission Assignment:} Specific permissions linked to each role
    \item \textbf{User Assignment:} Users assigned to appropriate roles based on their position
    \item \textbf{Session Management:} Role-based permissions enforced during user sessions
\end{itemize}

This approach ensures that students can only access their own profiles and eligible job listings, while administrators have broader access to manage the entire placement process. The implementation uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining session state and Passport.js for authentication strategies.

\section{Frontend Structure}
The React frontend follows a well-organized component-based architecture:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.2cm, sibling distance=3cm, 
                        level 1/.style={sibling distance=4cm},
                        level 2/.style={sibling distance=2cm}]
        \node {src}
            child {node {components}
                child {node {admin}}
                child {node {student}}
                child {node {shared}}
                child {node {auth}}
            }
            child {node {pages}
                child {node {AdminPages}}
                child {node {StudentPages}}
                child {node {AuthPages}}
            }
            child {node {contexts}
                child {node {AuthContext}}
                child {node {NotificationContext}}
            }
            child {node {services}
                child {node {api.js}}
                child {node {auth.js}}
            };
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Frontend Project Structure}
    \label{fig:frontend-structure}
\end{figure}

The React application follows best practices for organization:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Components:} Reusable UI elements organized by user type and functionality
    \item \textbf{Pages:} Complete page layouts combining multiple components
    \item \textbf{Contexts:} React Context API implementations for global state management
    \item \textbf{Services:} Modules for external API communication and business logic
    \item \textbf{Utils:} Helper functions and utilities for common operations
    \item \textbf{Hooks:} Custom React hooks for reusable stateful logic
    \item \textbf{Assets:} Static resources including images, icons, and stylesheets
\end{itemize}

\section{Backend Structure}
The Node.js/Express backend is organized following the MVC pattern:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[level distance=1.2cm, sibling distance=3cm,
                        level 1/.style={sibling distance=3.5cm},

\end{figure}

\subsection{Authentication Code Samples}

\subsubsection{Backend JWT Authentication}
The backend implements custom JWT-based authentication:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=JWT Authentication Middleware]
// Middleware to verify JWT tokens
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.cookies.token;
    
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'No authentication token, access denied' });
    }
    
    const verified = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.user = verified;
    
    // Attach model name based on user role for database operations
    if (req.user.role === 'student') {
      req.model = req.user.department; // CE, CSE, IT, etc.
    }
    
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Token verification failed' });
  }
};

// Role-based authorization middleware
const authorize = (roles = []) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication required' });
    }
    
    if (roles.length && !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Insufficient permissions' });
    }
    
    next();
  };
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{React Protected Routes}
The frontend implements protected routes using React Router:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Protected Route Component]
// Component to protect routes based on authentication and role
const ProtectedRoute = ({ component: Component, roles, ...rest }) => {
  const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <Route
      {...rest}
      render={(props) => {
        // Show loading spinner while checking authentication
        if (isLoading) {
          return <LoadingSpinner />;
        }
        
        // Redirect to login if not authenticated
        if (!user) {
          return <Redirect to={{
            pathname: '/login',
            state: { from: props.location }
          }} />;
        }
        
        // Check if user has required role
        if (roles && !roles.includes(user.role)) {
          return <Redirect to="/unauthorized" />;
        }
        
        // Render requested component if all checks pass
        return <Component {...props} />;
      }}
    />
  );
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Notification Code Samples}

\subsubsection{Notification Creation}
The backend implements notification creation functionality:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Notification Creation Function]
// Function to create a new notification
const createNotification = async (studentId, studentModel, options) => {
  try {
    const { type, title, message, company = null } = options;
    
    const notification = new Notification({
      student: studentId,
      studentModel,
      type,
      title,
      message,
      status: 'unread',
      company,
      createdAt: new Date()
    });
    
    await notification.save();
    
    // Emit real-time notification if Socket.IO is used
    if (io) {
      io.to(`student-${studentId}`).emit('notification', {
        id: notification._id,
        type,
        title,
        message
      });
    }
    
    return notification;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Notification creation error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Example: Create notification for application status change
const notifyApplicationStatusChange = async (application, newStatus) => {
  const { student, studentModel, company } = application;
  
  // Get company name
  const companyDoc = await Company.findById(company);
  const companyName = companyDoc ? companyDoc.name : 'a company';
  
  // Create notification based on status
  const notificationOptions = {
    type: 'application',
    company,
    title: `Application Status Updated`,
    message: `Your application for ${companyName} has been updated to "${newStatus}"`
  };
  
  return createNotification(student, studentModel, notificationOptions);
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Frontend Notification Component}
The React notification badge and dropdown component:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Notification Badge Component]
const NotificationBadge = () => {
  const { notifications, markAsRead } = useNotifications();
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  
  const unreadCount = useMemo(() => {
    return notifications.filter(n => n.status === 'unread').length;
  }, [notifications]);
  
  const toggleNotifications = () => setIsOpen(!isOpen);
  
  const handleMarkAsRead = (id) => {
    markAsRead(id);
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="notification-container">
      <button className="notification-bell" onClick={toggleNotifications}>
        <BellIcon />
        {unreadCount > 0 && (
          <span className="notification-badge">{unreadCount}</span>
        )}
      </button>
      
      {isOpen && (
        <div className="notification-dropdown">

              <button onClick={() => markAsRead('all')}>
                Mark all as read
              </button>
            )}
          </div>
          
          <div className="notification-list">
            {notifications.length === 0 ? (

        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Application Management Implementation}
The application management system handles the lifecycle of student job applications:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=JavaScript, caption=Application Status Update Function]
// Update application status with appropriate notifications
const updateApplicationStatus = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    const { status, feedback, interviewDate, packageOffered } = req.body;
    
    // Find the application
    const application = await Application.findById(id);
    if (!application) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Application not found' });
    }
    
    // Update application with new information
    application.status = status;
    
    if (feedback) application.feedback = feedback;
    if (interviewDate) application.interviewDate = new Date(interviewDate);
    if (packageOffered) application.packageOffered = packageOffered;
    
    // Save updated application
    await application.save();
    
    // Create notification for the student
    await notifyApplicationStatusChange(application, status);
    
    // Create interview notification if status is "Interview Scheduled"
    if (status === 'Interview Scheduled' && interviewDate) {
      const company = await Company.findById(application.company);
      const companyName = company ? company.name : 'a company';
      
      await createNotification(
        application.student, 
        application.studentModel,
        {
          type: 'interview',
          company: application.company,
          title: 'Interview Scheduled',
          message: `Your interview with ${companyName} is scheduled for ${new Date(interviewDate).toLocaleString()}`,
        }
      );
    }
    
    res.status(200).json({
